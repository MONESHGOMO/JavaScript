# JavaScript Basics: A Beginner’s Guide

JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, powering interactive and dynamic web applications. In this guide, we’ll explore the history of JavaScript, its core concepts like variables, conditions, loops, ECMAScript updates, and common methods for strings, arrays, and objects. Finally, we’ll walk through creating a simple "Hello World" application.

## 1. A Brief History of JavaScript
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape. It was initially developed in just ten days and was first called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally renamed JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.

Key milestones in JavaScript’s evolution include:

- **1997**: ECMAScript (ES) was established as the standard for JavaScript.
- **2009**: ES5 introduced features like strict mode and JSON support.
- **2015**: ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) brought significant updates like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals, and more.
- **Present**: JavaScript continues to evolve with regular ECMAScript updates, making it more powerful and developer-friendly.

Today, JavaScript is used for both client-side and server-side development (e.g., Node.js) and is a cornerstone of modern web development.
